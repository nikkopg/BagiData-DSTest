2. Dictionary/Corpus: Zip files in each folder in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1i0gnvMMidTIc1innlVYMRFDHGtm_mnfW?usp=sharing)

3. Explanation document: [slides.pdf](https://github.com/nikkopg/BagiData-DSTest/blob/main/Nikko%20P.%20Gunara%20-%20BagiData%20-%20Data%20Scientist%20Test.pdf)

Note:
- Explanation is also included in both Jupyter Notebook files.
- To use or load the pre-trained model, extract zip files in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook.
- Due to the storage limit in GitHub, the full files can be accessed through this [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1i0gnvMMidTIc1innlVYMRFDHGtm_mnfW?usp=sharing)
